# Airport and Flight Data Processing with Apache Spark, SQL, and Docker
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a scalable solution to process large datasets generated by various sources, such as FlightRadar. The system will process airport and flight data, store results in a SQL database, and package the entire solution with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into the following parts:

Storing Processed Data in a SQL Database
Dockerizing the Application
Key Requirements
Data Processing: Process large datasets (e.g., adsb.json and oag.json) using Apache Spark. Clean, aggregate, and transform the data to perform analysis like computing delayed flights.
SQL Database: Design a relational database model to store the processed data and ensure efficient querying for future analysis.
Dockerization: Containerize the entire application, including Apache Spark, the SQL database (PostgreSQL), and any other necessary dependencies, into Docker containers for easy deployment.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two primary JSON files:

adsb_multi_aircraft.json: Contains flight information for multiple aircraft.
oag_multiple.json: Contains operational flight data from OAG (Official Aviation Guide).
These datasets will be processed using Apache Spark, and the results will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker and Docker Compose
Python 3.x
Apache Spark (will be managed via Docker)
PostgreSQL (also managed via Docker)
Celery (for asynchronous task processing)
Step-by-Step Setup

### Step-by-Step Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-data-processing.git
  cd flight-data-processing`

### 2.Setup ENV
   - You can ask me for `.env` or follow the `example.envi` file and customize on your own

### 3. Docker Setup
Build and start the application with Docker Compose:

`bash
docker-compose up --build`
This will build and start the following services:

- Django Backend: The Django application that exposes an API to interact with the processed data.
- PostgreSQL: The database service to store the processed flight data.
- Redis: The message broker for Celery.
- Celery: For processing data asynchronously.
- Spark: The data processing engine that processes the flight data

### 4. Check Delayed Flights
To check the total number of delayed flights (both arrival and departure delays), you can visit the following URL in your browser:

`http://localhost:8000/api/delayed-flights/`
This endpoint will return a list of flights with their delay statuses, calculated based on the actual and estimated times of departure and arrival.
